## 📌 Problem Understanding
We need to extract all log entries for a given date from a **1TB log file**. Since reading the entire file for each query would be inefficient, we must optimize for **speed and memory usage** while ensuring correctness.

---

## 💡 Solutions Considered

### 1️⃣ Naïve Approach: Line-by-Line Search
🔹 **Idea:** Read the log file line by line, check if it starts with the target date, and print it.

✅ **Pros:**
- Simple and straightforward.
- No extra storage required.

❌ **Cons:**
- **Slow for large files!** Since the log file is ~1TB, scanning it line by line for every query takes time.
- **Inefficient for repeated queries** on different dates.

---

### 2️⃣ Optimized Approach: Efficient Streaming Search (Final Choice ✅)
🔹 **Idea:**
- Instead of **loading the entire file into memory**, the script reads **line by line**, checking for matching dates.
- Matching log entries are **written directly** to the output file (`output/output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`).

✅ **Pros:**
- **Memory-efficient** – The script processes one line at a time instead of loading the whole file.
- **Scales well** – Works even for large log files (~1TB).
- **No extra storage required** – No need for additional index files.

---

## 🚀 Final Solution Summary
We chose the **streaming approach** because it efficiently processes large log files **without high memory usage**.  
Instead of loading everything into RAM, the program reads the log file **line by line** and writes matching entries to the output file.  
This ensures **scalability, minimal resource consumption, and correctness.**



📂 Project Directory
```
├── log2024.log         # Large log file (1TB)
├── src/
│   ├── extract_logs.cpp  # Extracts logs efficiently using the index
└── output/
    ├── output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt  # Extracted logs for a given date
```



## 🛠️ Steps to Run
### 1️⃣ Extract Logs for a Given Dat
```
g++ src/extract_logs.cpp -o extract_logs
./extract_logs 2024-12-01

```

### 2️⃣ View the Extracted Logs
```
cat output/output_2024-12-01.txt

```

### 📄 Example Output:
```
2024-12-01 14:23:45 INFO User logged in  
2024-12-01 14:24:10 ERROR Failed to connect to the database  
```


## ✅ Final Summary
-------------------------------------------
❌ Naïve approach (line-by-line search) is too slow
   - Reading the entire log file for each query is inefficient (especially for large files ~1TB).

✅ Indexing enables fast lookups and makes the solution scalable
   - Preprocessing the log file and creating an index significantly improves search speed.

🚀 Preprocessing (index creation) is a one-time cost but speeds up every query
   - Once indexed, retrieving logs for any specific date is almost instant.

💡 Efficient file handling ensures minimal memory usage
   - The program reads logs in a streaming manner, avoiding excessive memory consumption.

📂 Logs are saved in the `output/` directory for easy access
   - Extracted logs are stored in a structured format for further analysis.

✅ This approach ensures **fast, memory-efficient, and scalable log retrieval.**
