## 📌 Problem Understanding
We need to extract all log entries for a given date from a **1TB log file**. Since reading the entire file for each query would be inefficient, we must optimize for **speed and memory usage** while ensuring correctness.

---

## 💡 Solutions Considered

### 1️⃣ Naïve Approach: Line-by-Line Search
🔹 **Idea:** Read the log file line by line, check if it starts with the target date, and print it.

✅ **Pros:**
- Simple and straightforward.
- No extra storage required.

❌ **Cons:**
- **Too slow!** Since the log file is 1TB, scanning it line by line for every query would take hours.
- **Inefficient for repeated queries** on different dates.

---

### 2️⃣ Optimized Approach: Indexing for Fast Lookups (Final Choice ✅)
🔹 **Idea:**
1. **Preprocessing Step:** Create an **index file** (`log_index.txt`) mapping each date to its byte offset in the log file.
2. **Query Step:** Use the index to seek directly to the correct position in the log file and read only the relevant logs.

✅ **Pros:**
- **Super fast lookups!** No need to read unnecessary lines.
- **Minimal memory usage** (only storing offsets per date).
- **Scales well** with large files.

❌ **Cons:**
- Requires a **one-time preprocessing step** (indexing the file), but this is much faster than scanning for every query.

## 🚀 Final Solution Summary
We chose the **indexing approach** because it significantly reduces lookup time by allowing **direct access** to relevant log entries.  
Instead of scanning the whole file, we **jump to the correct position instantly** based on the index.


📂 Project Directory
```
├── log2024.log         # Large log file (1TB)
├── src/
│   ├── extract_logs.cpp  # Extracts logs efficiently using the index
└── output/
    ├── output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt  # Extracted logs for a given date
```



## 🛠️ Steps to Run
### 1️⃣ Extract Logs for a Given Dat
```
g++ src/extract_logs.cpp -o extract_logs
./extract_logs 2024-12-01

```

### 2️⃣ View the Extracted Logs
```
cat output/output_2024-12-01.txt

```

### 📄 Example Output:
```
2024-12-01 14:23:45 INFO User logged in  
2024-12-01 14:24:10 ERROR Failed to connect to the database  
```


## ✅ Final Summary
-------------------------------------------
❌ Naïve approach (line-by-line search) is too slow
   - Reading the entire log file for each query is inefficient (especially for large files ~1TB).

✅ Indexing enables fast lookups and makes the solution scalable
   - Preprocessing the log file and creating an index significantly improves search speed.

🚀 Preprocessing (index creation) is a one-time cost but speeds up every query
   - Once indexed, retrieving logs for any specific date is almost instant.

💡 Efficient file handling ensures minimal memory usage
   - The program reads logs in a streaming manner, avoiding excessive memory consumption.

📂 Logs are saved in the `output/` directory for easy access
   - Extracted logs are stored in a structured format for further analysis.

✅ This approach ensures **fast, memory-efficient, and scalable log retrieval.**
